Allows to easily add interactive charts and maps using amCharts libraries.

== Description ==

Ever tried getting JavaScript content into your Wordpress posts or pages? Yeah, that's impossible. WP strips down all
the JavaScript.

This makes adding JavaScript Charts and Maps a hassle.

Developed and maintained by amCharts staff, this plugin solves the problem by allowing you to create chart code snippets, that then subsequently can be inserted into the
posts or pages as a shortcode. (helpful button in TinyMCE is also there)

You can also use a built-in PHP function to invoke the chart anywhere in your template:

`<?php amcharts_insert( $chart_id ); ?>`

The plugin has also many helpful functions:

*   Easy switching between CDN-hosted or local chart/map libraries storage
*   Setting defaults per chart type
*   Automatically locating installed libraries and available resources

== Installation ==

Use Wordpress Plugin page to search and install the amCharts plugin.

If you choose to install in manually, make sure all the files from the downloaded archive are placed into your `/wp-content/plugins/amcharts/` directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with the free/commercial versions of amCharts libraries =

Yes. You can either set the plugin to use publically available libraries loaded from www.amcharts.com or from your local server.

= Will I be able to visually edit settings and data? =

No. This plugin allows editing a code directly in Wordpress admin as well as inserting the charts into posts or pages using shortcodes.

It's not a fully fledged chart/map editor. It's a plugin designed to get your chart/map code into Wordpress easily.

= Do I need to include any JavaScript libraries in my theme code? =

Nope. The plugin will take care of that for you. The required JavaScript libraries will be included in the footer of the page automatically.

Plugin will include only those libraries that are actually required to render the chart. If no charts are there on the page, no additional libraries will be included.

Let's keep the footprint small ;)

= Can I insert a chart directly from my PHP code rather than shortcode? =

Yes. Use the following PHP code:

`<?php amcharts_insert( $chart_id ); ?>`

Or, you can retrieve the chart object using following function:

`<?php amcharts_get( $chart_id ); ?>`

This will return an object with the following properties:

*   title - a chart title
*   post - a reference to original WP post object
*   resources - a list of resource urls
*   html - HTML code
*   javascript - JavaScript code

= Can I pass custom parameters to chart code via shortcode? =

Yes, starting from version 1.0.7.

Any parameter prefixed with "data-" will be passed into chart code via global AmCharts.wpChartData object.

I.e.:

`[amcharts id="pie-1" data-file="data1.csv" data-sort="asc"]`

The above shortcode will insert the following code **before** actual chart code:

`AmCharts.wpChartData = {
  "file": "data1.csv",
  "sort": "asc"
}`

You can then reference those passed variables in your chart code. I.e.:

`alert( AmCharts.wpChartData.file );`

= Are there any filters available?

Yes:

*   amcharts_shortcode_data ( $data - parsed data passed in via data-* parameters of the shortcode, $atts )
*   amcharts_shortcode_resources ( $resources - text data from resources box, $atts )
*   amcharts_shortcode_libs ( $libs - array of resouces, $atts )
*   amcharts_shortcode_javascript ( $javascript - JavaScript portion of the chart, $atts )
*   amcharts_shortcode_html ( $html - HTML portion of the chart, $atts )

= Is this plugin WPML-compatible?

Yup. It fully supports WPML. You can create language-specific versions of the charts and maps. The plugin will automatically select proper language when displaying it.

== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin configuration. Either use amCharts-hosted free libraries or your own. Set default code per chart/map type.
2. Easily create new charts or maps using presets right from the Admin menu.
3. Modify resources, HTML or JavaScript portion of the chart. Or apply defaults right from the edit screen.
4. Insert chart easily into body of the post or page using button from the rich editor tool belt. The charts are inserted as Wordpress shortcodes.
5. Select from the available charts or maps. No coding required.
6. Embed a chart created in Live Editor directly into your posts or pages.
7. The chart shortcodes are replaced with the actual charts when page renders.
